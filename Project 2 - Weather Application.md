# Project 2: Weather Application

A typical "first project" that many novice programmers are recommended is to make an application that can interface with some kind of weather API because of how many topics it can cover at once, specifically API requests, parsing API data, getting user input, and so on. I personally liked the idea of doing something related to the weather to start because it's immediately useful and hits all the previous high notes, so you'll do that too!
